# TinyCrypt
Tiny encryption library I wrote during a single chemistry period (instead of studying). Uses a password to encrypt and decrypt a string.

# Encryption
* Line 8 defines a formula used to create a number that you add/subtract from each char using the password
* to_skip determines if you skip 1-2 chars
* reverse determines if you reverse the final character set
* addsub determines if you ADD or SUBTRACT from each char in the original string

# Decryption
* Literally does all the same stuff backwards :)
